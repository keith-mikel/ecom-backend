 To use the eccomerce backend first clone the repository locally, run NPM install to get all required node modules. Next within your mysql terminal login, then run the schema.sql file to setup the required database for this app. Once this is done the NPM RUN SEED command can be done to fill the database with test data or the database can be filled with your personal data if desired. Once the database is populated us the NPM START command to initiate the server and open it for requests. This will allow the API tool such as insomnia to make requests to the server to access the data in your seeded database. Choose between what needs to be done, be it update, create, view, or delete, and what it needs to be done to based on the routes provided in the demo
 api/categories
 api/products
 api/tags
 These routes can be used for all CRUD operations, the ID may be added /:id after any of these as well to perform operations on an individual ID as well.
